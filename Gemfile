# your gemspec. These might include edge Rails or gems from your path or
# Git. Remember to move these dependencies to your gemspec before releasing
# your gem to rubygems.org.

# To use debugger
# gem 'debugger'

# TODO: remove this from here and add it to the gemspec as a development dependency,
# once the testing gem is released
